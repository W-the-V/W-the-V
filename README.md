### Hello, my name is Walter.


I have always been fascinated with technology, even from a young age. When I was eleven, my laptop stopped working after the power cord outlet took a dive. Unable to buy a new laptop, and reluctant to lose access to the internet, I decided I had to fix it. My idea was to splice the power cord into the laptop directly as I knew that was the issue. Luckily for me, my solution, and eventually the computer, worked. Understanding how things work has always been a significant motivation in my academic and professional pursuits.

This eventually led to my decision to make a career change to software engineering. In pursuit of this, I recently graduated from App Academy and built multiple full-stack applications. This cemented my interest in coding as a career. While furthering my understanding of such technologies as JavaScript, React, and Redux I found that it was something that I truly enjoyed.

I am thankful that I found coding as a career, as it allows me to do something that I enjoy for a living. I am always open to collaborative projects. Feel free to reach out to me anytime and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
